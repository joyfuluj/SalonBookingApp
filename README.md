# COSC 341: Human Computer Interaction Project

## Overview
This project aimed to help users easily book appointments at salons in Kelowna city. It offers a streamlined experience for customers while providing a powerful management tool for salon staff.

It was conducted in four key steps, each of which is documented in a corresponding PDF.

## Steps of the Project

### Step 1: Defining Usability and User Experience Goals
 
In this step, we conducted a detailed analysis to ensure the usability and user experience goals of our system align with user needs. The focus was on defining usability criteria, user experience goals, user profiles, and creating personas to represent key users.

### Step 2: Requirement Gathering

This step aimed to identify user requirements for the system by engaging with both primary and secondary users. A requirement-gathering technique was selected to collect valuable feedback, which was then categorized into functional, data, environment, and usability requirements.

### Step 3: Prototyping and Evaluation

During this phase, the focus was on designing and refining prototypes for five key tasks in the system. These tasks were carefully selected to reflect essential user activities, ensuring they were not related to login, data management, or help functions. User feedback was gathered at multiple stages, which helped in iterating on the prototypes to improve both usability and functionality. The process culminated in a demonstration video that showcases the refined prototypes, highlighting how the system is intended to be used for the five major tasks.

### Step 4: Implementation and Heuristic Evaluation

Finally, we developed a vertical prototype for the project, addressing the four key tasks (as suggested by the professor, due to time constraints) identified in previous steps. The prototype was designed to be fully functional, offering users an interactive experience with real-time error handling and smooth task execution.

In addition, a heuristic evaluation was conducted to identify usability issues based on Nielsen's heuristics. The feedback gathered from this evaluation was incorporated into the prototype, ensuring improvements were made to enhance the overall user experience and address any usability concerns.
